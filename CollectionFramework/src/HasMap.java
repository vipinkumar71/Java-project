/*
*************** HashMap **************************
* HashMap in java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized.
* It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key.
* Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, Where K stands for key and V stands for value.
* It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the map interface.

*
* Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
* Java HasMap Contains only unique Keys.
* Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
* Java HashMap is non synchronized.
* Java HashMap Maintains no order.
* Randomly storage.
