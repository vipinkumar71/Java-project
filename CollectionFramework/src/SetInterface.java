//*********** ABOUT Set interface **************************************

/* HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
* A set is a collection that can not contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction.
* Duplicate value can not be stored !!!!!

* add()
* Add an object to the collection.

* clear()
* Remove all Objects from the Collection.

* Contains()
* Return true  if a Specified Object is an element within the Collection.

* isEmpty()
* Return true if the Collection has no elements.

* iterator()
* Returns an Iterator Object for the Collection, which may be used to retrieve an object.

* remove()
* Remove a specified Object from the Collection

* size()
* Return the number of elements in the collection

* ****************** Hashset ***************
*
* Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that  uses  a hash table  for storage.
     * It inherits the AbstractSet Class and implements Set interface............
     * Hashset Stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing......
     * Hashset contain unique elements only. Hashset allow null value.

* No guarantee is made as to the iteration order of the set which means that the class does not guarantee
* The constant order of elements over time.
* Hashset also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
* As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate value are not allowed.
* The underlying data structure for Hashset is hashtable.
* Hashing Algorithm

* Storing Randomly

************ LinkedHashSet ************************
* Extends HasSet AbstractSet
* Pretend LinkedList and HashTable
* Orderly Storage
* Java LinkedHashSet class contains unique element only like Hashset.
*   Java LinkedHashSet class provides all Optional set operation and permits null elements.
*   Java LinkedHasSet class is non synchronized.
*   Java LinkedHasSet class maintains insertion order.
* The LinkedHasSet class extends HasSet class which implement Set interface.
*      The Set interface inherits Collection and Iterable Interface in hierarchical order.
