// Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
// Java uses the Concept of a Stream to make I/O Operation fast.
// The Java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operation.
// We can perform file handling in java by java I/O API.
//
//
// In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.
// 1) System.out: standard output stream
// output is used to write something
// input is used to read something
// 2) System.in: standard input stream
// 3) System.err: standard error stream
