//Polymorphism
//Polymorphism is ONE class with MORE functionalities or features

//Poly means many, morphism means more forms
// private and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden.
//The most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required.
// Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class.
// //  @Override
//    // a static method can not be override

// Multiple extends not possible in java
// because our child class will not understand which super class I should call.
